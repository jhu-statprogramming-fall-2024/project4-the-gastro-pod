SNASHBOARD: The Snail Dashboard

 

Snashboard is an interactive data visualization tool that combines citizen science research grade observations with geolocation of discovered gastropod fossils, made by Lulu Singer, Jack Zhu and Jill Hakim. It uses data from iNatrualist (https://www.inaturalist.org/) and the paleobiology database (https://paleobiodb.org/) to produce an interface that primarily builds upon the concept of a "snails near you" button as well as the entertaining titular portmanteau. 

This repo contains the files for the full snashboard, which included shapefiles from Natural Earth (ne folder) and code to include administrative boundaries from Open Street Map. These are meant to be downloaded and run locally, but please note that the dashboard may take a while to load once a location is entered! 

A lightweight version of snashboard is deployed at https://lsinger-bio.shinyapps.io/snashboard/ , which does not include shape files for the maps (for now).
